# Connecting Java and MySQL with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a MySQL instance running, skip the steps to install MySQL, start it, load data, and stop it.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up MySQL

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a MySQL instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -p 3306:3306 mysql
    ```

3. Create a table in MySQL and load data into it:

    ```sh
    cat games.sql | docker exec -i some-mysql mysql --user=root --password=my-secret-pw
    ```

### Connect to MySQL

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install mysql
    ```

2. Customize the `main` method in `Example.java`
    - Change the connection arguments in the `params.put()` calls
        - Format `uri` according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name), or keep it as is to use the data included with this example
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.setSqlQuery()`

3. Run the Java program:

    ```sh
    mvn compile exec:exec
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running MySQL:

```sh
docker stop some-mysql
```
