# Connecting Python and MariaDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a MariaDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up MariaDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up MariaDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a MariaDB instance:

    ```sh
    docker run --detach --name some-mariadb -p 3306:3306 --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mariadb:latest
    ```

### Connect to MariaDB

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install mysql
    ```

2. Customize the Python script `main.py` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `db_kwargs`
        - Format `uri` according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `cursor.execute()`

3. Run the Python script:

   ```sh
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running MariaDB:

```sh
docker stop some-mariadb
```
