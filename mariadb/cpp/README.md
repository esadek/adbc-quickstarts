# Connecting C++ and MariaDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a MariaDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up MariaDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up MariaDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a MariaDB instance:

    ```sh
    docker run --detach --name some-mariadb -p 3306:3306 --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mariadb:latest
    ```

### Connect to MariaDB

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install --level user mysql
    ```

2. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
        - Format `uri` according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

3. Build and run the C++ program:

    Using Make:
    ```sh
    pixi run make
    ./mariadb_demo
    ```

    Or using CMake:
    ```sh
    pixi run cmake -B build
    pixi run cmake --build build
    ./build/mariadb_demo
    ```

### Clean up

1. Clean build artifacts:

    Using Make:
    ```sh
    pixi run make clean
    ```

    Using CMake:
    ```sh
    rm -rf build
    ```

2. Stop the Docker container running MariaDB:

    ```sh
    docker stop some-mariadb
    ```
