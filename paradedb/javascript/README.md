# Connecting JavaScript and ParadeDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a ParadeDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up ParadeDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
   - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up ParadeDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1. Start a ParadeDB instance:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 paradedb/paradedb
   ```

### Connect to ParadeDB

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install postgresql
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `databaseOptions`
     - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is
   - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()`

1. Run the script:

   **Node.js:**

   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```

   **Bun:**

   ```sh
   bun run main.js
   ```

   **Deno:**

   ```sh
   deno run --allow-ffi --allow-env main.js
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running ParadeDB:

```sh
docker stop paradedb
```
