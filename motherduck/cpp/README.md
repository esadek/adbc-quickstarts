# Connecting C++ and MotherDuck with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Create a MotherDuck account](https://motherduck.com/)

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. (Optional) Create an access token in MotherDuck and save it as the environment variable `motherduck_token` as described at [Authenticating to MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/authenticating-to-motherduck/#authentication-using-an-access-token). If you skip this step, a browser window will open each time you connect, asking you to log in or confirm access.

### Connect to MotherDuck

1. Install the DuckDB ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user duckdb
   ```

1. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
     - Set `path` to the name of a MotherDuck database (prefixed with `md:`), or keep it set to `md:sample_data` to use MotherDuck's sample data
   - Change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()` to query the tables in your database

1. Build and run the C++ program:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make
   ./motherduck_demo
   ```

   Or using CMake:
   ```sh
   pixi run cmake -B build
   pixi run cmake --build build
   ./build/motherduck_demo
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If MotherDuck reports that you are not using a compatible DuckDB version, you can install the specific version it requires by running:
> ```sh
> dbc install --level user "duckdb=X.Y.Z"
> ```

### Clean up

1. Clean build artifacts:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make clean
   ```

   Using CMake:
   ```sh
   rm -rf build
   ```
