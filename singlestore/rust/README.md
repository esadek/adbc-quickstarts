# Connecting Rust and SingleStore with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a SingleStore instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up SingleStore.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up SingleStore

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a SingleStore instance:

    ```sh
    docker run \
        -d --rm --name singlestoredb-dev \
        -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD" \
        -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
        ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To run the container on Apple Silicon, add the `--platform linux/amd64` option.

### Connect to SingleStore

1. Install the SingleStore ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install --pre singlestore
    ```

2. Customize `src/main.rs` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `opts`
        - Format the URI according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name)
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `statement.set_sql_query()`

3. Run the Rust program:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running SingleStore:

```sh
docker stop singlestoredb-dev
```
