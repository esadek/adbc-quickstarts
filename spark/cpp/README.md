# Connecting C++ and Apache Spark with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Spark instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Spark.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Spark

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1. Start a Spark instance:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name spark-connect -p 15002:15002 apache/spark:4.1.2 bash -c "/opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh && tail -f /dev/null"
   ```

### Connect to Spark

1. Install the Spark ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user spark
   ```

1. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp`
   - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
     - Format `uri` according to the [driver documentation](https://docs.adbc-drivers.org/drivers/spark/index.html#connecting), or keep it as is
   - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

1. Build and run the C++ program:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make
   ./spark_demo
   ```

   Or using CMake:
   ```sh
   pixi run cmake -B build
   pixi run cmake --build build
   ./build/spark_demo
   ```

### Clean up

1. Stop the Docker container running Spark:

   ```sh
   docker stop spark-connect
   ```

1. Clean build artifacts:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make clean
   ```

   Using CMake:
   ```sh
   rm -rf build
   ```
