# Connecting JavaScript and Apache Spark with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Spark instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Spark.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
   - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Spark

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1. Start a Spark instance:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name spark-connect -p 15002:15002 apache/spark:4.1.2 bash -c "/opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh && tail -f /dev/null"
   ```

### Connect to Spark

1. Install the Spark ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install spark
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `databaseOptions`
     - Format `uri` according to the [driver documentation](https://docs.adbc-drivers.org/drivers/spark/index.html#connecting), or keep it as is
   - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()`

1. Run the script:

   **Node.js:**

   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```

   **Bun:**

   ```sh
   bun run main.js
   ```

   **Deno:**

   ```sh
   deno run --allow-ffi --allow-env main.js
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running Spark:

```sh
docker stop spark-connect
```
