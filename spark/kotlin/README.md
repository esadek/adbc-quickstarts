# Connecting Kotlin and Apache Spark with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Spark instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Spark.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)

1.  [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Spark

1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1.  Start a Spark instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name spark-connect -p 15002:15002 apache/spark:4.1.2 bash -c "/opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh && tail -f /dev/null"
    ```

### Connect to Spark

1.  Install the Spark ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install spark
    ```

1.  Customize the `main` function in `Main.kt`
    -   Change the connection arguments in `params`
        -   Format `uri` according to the [driver documentation](https://docs.adbc-drivers.org/drivers/spark/index.html#connecting), or keep it as is
    -   If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.setSqlQuery`

1.  Run the Kotlin program:

    ```sh
    gradle run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running Spark:

```sh
docker stop spark-connect
```
