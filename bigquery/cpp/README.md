# Connecting C++ and BigQuery with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

1. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com) or be able to log in to an existing one

### Set up BigQuery

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create project or locate an existing project and record the project ID for use in a later step

1. Run this command in your terminal to log in with the Google Cloud CLI:

   ```sh
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

### Connect to BigQuery

1. Install the BigQuery ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user bigquery
   ```

1. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
     - Change the value of the `adbc.bigquery.sql.project_id` argument to match the project ID you recorded in the earlier step
     - Change the value of `adbc.bigquery.sql.dataset_id`, or keep it to use the public Shakespeare dataset
   - If you changed the dataset, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

1. Build and run the C++ program:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make
   ./bigquery_demo
   ```

   Or using CMake:
   ```sh
   pixi run cmake -B build
   pixi run cmake --build build
   ./build/bigquery_demo
   ```

### Clean up

1. Clean build artifacts:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make clean
   ```

   Using CMake:
   ```sh
   rm -rf build
   ```
