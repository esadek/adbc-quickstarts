# Connecting Go and BigQuery with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

1. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com) or be able to log in to an existing one

### Set up BigQuery

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create project or locate an existing project and record the project ID for use in a later step

1. Run this command in your terminal to log in with the Google Cloud CLI:

   ```sh
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

### Connect to BigQuery

1. Install the BigQuery ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install bigquery
   ```

1. Customize the Go program `main.go` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in the `NewDatabase()` call
     - Change the value of the `adbc.bigquery.sql.project_id` argument to match the project ID you recorded in the earlier step
     - Change the value of `adbc.bigquery.sql.dataset_id`, or keep it to use the public Shakespeare dataset
   - If you changed the dataset, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.SetSqlQuery()`

1. Run the Go program:

   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   go run main.go
   ```
