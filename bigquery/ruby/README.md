# Connecting Ruby and BigQuery with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. Ensure the native Arrow GLib and ADBC GLib libraries required by `red-adbc`
   are installed and discoverable. If `bundle install` reports missing `arrow`,
   `arrow-glib`, or `adbc-glib`, use the platform-specific commands below.

   <details>
   <summary>macOS with Homebrew</summary>

   ```sh
   brew install apache-arrow-glib apache-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Debian/Ubuntu</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libarrow-glib-dev libadbc-glib-dev
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>RHEL-compatible distributions</summary>

   ```sh
   sudo dnf install arrow-glib-devel adbc-glib-devel
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Windows with RubyInstaller/MSYS2 UCRT64</summary>

   ```sh
   pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-arrow-adbc-glib
   ```

   If you use a different MSYS2 environment, adjust the package prefix to match
   it; for example, use `mingw-w64-x86_64-*` from the MINGW64 shell.

   </details>

1. Install Ruby dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

   If you have multiple Ruby installations, ensure `ruby` and `bundle` resolve
   to the same installation before running this command.

1. [Install Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

1. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com) or be able to log in to an existing one

### Set up BigQuery

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create project or locate an existing project and record the project ID for use in a later step

1. Run this command in your terminal to log in with the Google Cloud CLI:

   ```sh
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

### Connect to BigQuery

1. Install the BigQuery ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user bigquery
   ```

1. Customize the Ruby script `main.rb` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `database.set_option()`
     - Change the value of the `adbc.bigquery.sql.project_id` argument to match the project ID you recorded in the earlier step
     - Change the value of `adbc.bigquery.sql.dataset_id`, or keep it to use the public Shakespeare dataset
   - If you changed the dataset, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `connection.query()`

1. Run the Ruby script:

   ```sh
   bundle exec ruby main.rb
   ```
