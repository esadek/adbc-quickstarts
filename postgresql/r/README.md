# Connecting R and PostgreSQL with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a PostgreSQL instance running, skip the steps to install PostgreSQL, start it, load data, and stop it.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

3. Install R packages `adbcdrivermanager`, `arrow`, and `tibble`:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("adbcdrivermanager", "arrow", "tibble"))
    ```

### Set up PostgreSQL

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a PostgreSQL instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 postgres
    ```

3. Create a table in PostgreSQL and load data into it:

    ```sh
    cat games.sql | docker exec -i -e PGPASSWORD=mysecretpassword some-postgres psql -d postgres -U postgres
    ```

### Connect to PostgreSQL

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install postgresql
    ```

2. Customize the R script `main.R` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `adbc_database_init()`
        - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is to use the data included with this example
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `read_adbc()`

3. Run the R script:

    ```sh
    Rscript main.R
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running PostgreSQL:

```sh
docker stop some-postgres
```
