# Connecting Python and Sail with ADBC

## Instructions

This example uses [Sail](https://docs.lakesail.com/), a fast query engine that supports Arrow Flight SQL.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Sail Flight SQL server running, skip the steps to set up Sail.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Sail

1. Install Sail:

   ```sh
   uv tool install pysail
   ```

1. Start the Sail Flight SQL server:

   ```sh
   sail flight server --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 32010
   ```

   Alternatively, you can start the server programmatically using the Sail Python API. Install `pysail` into your environment:

   ```sh
   uv pip install pysail
   ```

   Then start the server:

   ```python
   from pysail.flight import FlightSqlServer

   server = FlightSqlServer(ip="127.0.0.1", port=32010)
   server.start(background=False)
   ```

### Connect to Sail

1. Install the Flight SQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install flightsql
   ```

1. Customize the Python script `main.py` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `db_kwargs`
     - `uri` is the URI of your Sail Flight SQL server. The host and port will depend on your installation (the default port is 32010). The protocol scheme should be `grpc` for plain connections or `grpc+tls` if your server is configured with TLS.
   - Change the SQL SELECT statement in `cursor.execute()` if desired

1. Run the Python script:

   ```sh
   uv run main.py
   ```

   The output will look something like this:

   ```
   pyarrow.Table
   result: int64
   ----
   result: [[2]]
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Sail Flight SQL server by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal where it is running.
