# Connecting Rust and Exasol with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have an Exasol instance running, skip the steps to run Exasol in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Exasol

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

> [!WARNING]
> The Exasol Docker image may not work with Docker for Windows or Docker for macOS. On macOS, we have found that [Colima](https://colima.run/)'s x86_64 emulation may work better. Alternatively, consider [Exasol Personal](https://www.exasol.com/campaigns/exasol-personal/) running in the cloud.

2. Start Exasol in a Docker container ([documentation](https://github.com/exasol/docker-db)):

   ```sh
   docker run \
      -p 127.0.0.1:9563:8563 \
      --name exasol \
      --privileged \
      --detach \
      exasol/docker-db:latest-2025.1
   ```

3. Create a table in Exasol and load data into it:

   ```sh
   docker cp games.sql exasol:/tmp/games.sql
   docker cp load-data.sh exasol:/tmp/load-data.sh
   docker exec exasol bash /tmp/load-data.sh
   ```

### Connect to Exasol

1. Install the Exasol ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install exasol
   ```

2. Customize `src/main.rs` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `opts`
     - Change `OptionDatabase::Uri` as needed, using query parameters to add more connection arguments, or keep it as is to use the data included with this example
   - If you changed which schema you're opening, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `statement.set_sql_query()`

3. Run the Rust program:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

### Clean up

1. Stop the Docker container running Exasol:

   ```sh
   docker stop exasol
   docker rm exasol
   ```
