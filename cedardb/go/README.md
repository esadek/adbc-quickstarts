# Connecting Go and CedarDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a CedarDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up CedarDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up CedarDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a CedarDB instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name cedardb -p 5432:5432 -e CEDAR_PASSWORD=test cedardb/cedardb
    ```

### Connect to CedarDB

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install postgresql
    ```

1. Customize the Go program `main.go` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in the `NewDatabase()` call
        - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.SetSqlQuery()`

1. Run the Go program:

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    go run main.go
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running CedarDB:

```sh
docker stop cedardb
```
