# Connecting JavaScript and DuckDB Quack Server with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a DuckDB Quack server instance running, skip the steps to set up DuckDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
    - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/install/)

### Set up DuckDB server

1. Start the DuckDB CLI:

    ```sh
    duckdb
    ```

1. Create a table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE penguins AS FROM read_csv('https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/penguins.csv', nullstr = 'NA');
    ```

1. Start a server from the DuckDB session:

    ```sql
    CALL quack_serve('quack:localhost');
    ```

    Note the `auth_token` value that DuckDB prints.

### Connect to DuckDB via Quack protocol

1. Install the Quack ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install --pre quack
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
    - Change the `uri` connection argument
        - Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the `auth_token` printed by DuckDB
        - Change the host and port if applicable
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()`

1. Run the script:

    **Node.js:**

    ```sh
    node main.js
    ```

    **Bun:**

    ```sh
    bun run main.js
    ```

    **Deno:**

    ```sh
    deno run --allow-ffi --allow-env main.js
    ```

### Clean up

If you started a DuckDB server, exit the DuckDB CLI:

```sql
.exit
```
