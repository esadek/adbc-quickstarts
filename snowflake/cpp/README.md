# Connecting C++ and Snowflake with ADBC

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Connect to Snowflake

1. Install the Snowflake ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user snowflake
   ```

1. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp`
   - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
     - See [Snowflake Driver Client Options](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/driver/snowflake.html#client-options) for the full list of available options
   - If you changed the database and schema, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

1. Build and run the C++ program:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make
   ./snowflake_demo
   ```

   Or using CMake:
   ```sh
   pixi run cmake -B build
   pixi run cmake --build build
   ./build/snowflake_demo
   ```

### Clean up

1. Clean build artifacts:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make clean
   ```

   Using CMake:
   ```sh
   rm -rf build
   ```
