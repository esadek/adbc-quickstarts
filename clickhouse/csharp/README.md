# Connecting C# and ClickHouse with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a ClickHouse instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up ClickHouse.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install the .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up ClickHouse

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a ClickHouse instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name some-clickhouse-server -p 8123:8123 -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=user -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=pass clickhouse/clickhouse-server
    ```

### Connect to ClickHouse

1. Install the ClickHouse ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install clickhouse
    ```

2. Customize the C# program `Program.cs`
    - Change the connection arguments passed to `driver.Open()`
        - Format `uri` according to the [ClickHouse HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement assigned to `stmt.SqlQuery`

3. Run the C# program:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running ClickHouse:

```sh
docker stop some-clickhouse-server
```
