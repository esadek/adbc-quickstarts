# Connecting C++ and ClickHouse with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a ClickHouse instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up ClickHouse.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up ClickHouse

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a ClickHouse instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name some-clickhouse-server -p 8123:8123 -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=user -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=pass clickhouse/clickhouse-server
    ```

### Connect to ClickHouse

1. Install the ClickHouse ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install --level user clickhouse
    ```

2. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp`
    - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
        - Format `uri` according to the [ClickHouse HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

3. Build and run the C++ program:

    Using Make:
    ```sh
    pixi run make
    ./clickhouse_demo
    ```

    Or using CMake:
    ```sh
    pixi run cmake -B build
    pixi run cmake --build build
    ./build/clickhouse_demo
    ```

### Clean up

1. Stop the Docker container running ClickHouse:

    ```sh
    docker stop some-clickhouse-server
    ```

2. Clean build artifacts:

    Using Make:
    ```sh
    pixi run make clean
    ```

    Using CMake:
    ```sh
    rm -rf build
    ```
