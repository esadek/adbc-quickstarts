# Connecting Kotlin and ClickHouse with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a ClickHouse instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up ClickHouse.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)

1.  [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up ClickHouse

1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1.  Start a ClickHouse instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name some-clickhouse-server -p 8123:8123 -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=user -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=pass clickhouse/clickhouse-server
    ```

### Connect to ClickHouse

1.  Install the ClickHouse ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install clickhouse
    ```

1.  Customize the `main` function in `Main.kt`
    -   Change the connection arguments in `params`
        -   Format `uri` according to the [ClickHouse HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http), or keep it as is
    -   If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.setSqlQuery`

1.  Run the Kotlin program:

    ```sh
    gradle run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running ClickHouse:

```sh
docker stop some-clickhouse-server
```
