# Connecting Java and Vitess with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Vitess instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Vitess.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Vitess

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a Vitess instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name=vttestserver \
        -p 33574:33574 \
        -p 33575:33575 \
        -p 33577:33577 \
        -e PORT=33574 \
        -e KEYSPACES=test,unsharded \
        -e NUM_SHARDS=2,1 \
        -e MYSQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=70000 \
        -e MYSQL_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
        -e VTCOMBO_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
        vitess/vttestserver:mysql80
    ```

    Wait a few moments before continuing to the next step to allow the Vitess container to fully initialize.

### Connect to Vitess

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install mysql
    ```

2. Customize the `main` method in `Example.java`
    - Change the connection arguments in the `params.put()` calls
        - Format `uri` according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.setSqlQuery()`

3. Run the Java program:

    ```sh
    mvn compile exec:exec
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running Vitess:

```sh
docker stop vttestserver
```
