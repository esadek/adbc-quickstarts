# Connecting Rust and Oracle Database with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have an Oracle Database instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Oracle Database.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Oracle Database

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a Oracle Database instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name oracle-db -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PWD=password container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest
    ```

3. Wait about a minute for the database to initialize.

### Connect to Oracle Database

1. The ADBC driver for Oracle is available from Columnar's private driver registry. Create a [Columnar Console](https://console.columnar.tech) account and activate a 14-day free trial. Then authenticate to the registry:

    ```sh
    dbc auth login
    ```

2. Install the ADBC driver for Oracle:

    ```sh
    dbc install oracle
    ```

3. Install the [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html) libraries.

4. Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux), `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS), or `PATH` (Windows) to make sure the Oracle Instant Client libraries are discoverable by your application.

5. Customize `src/main.rs` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `opts`
        - Change `OptionDatabase::Uri` as needed, using query parameters to add more connection arguments. Format `uri` according to the the following syntax: `oracle://[user[:password]@]host[:port][/serviceName][?param1=value1&param2=value2]`, or keep it as is.
    - Change the SQL SELECT statement in `statement.set_sql_query()`, or keep it as is.

6. Run the Rust program:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running Oracle Database:

```sh
docker stop oracle-db
```
