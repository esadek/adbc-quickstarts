# Connecting Rust and TiDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a TiDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up TiDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up TiDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. Start a TiDB instance:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name tidb-single -p 4000:4000 pingcap/tidb
    ```

### Connect to TiDB

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install mysql
    ```

2. Customize the Rust program `src/main.rs` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in `opts`
        - Format the URI according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#readme-dsn-data-source-name), or keep it as is
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `statement.set_sql_query()`

3. Compile and run the Rust program:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running TiDB:

```sh
docker stop tidb-single
```
