# Connecting JavaScript and TiDB with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a TiDB instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up TiDB.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22 or later)
   - Alternatively, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up TiDB

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1. Start a TiDB instance:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name tidb-single -p 4000:4000 pingcap/tidb
   ```

### Connect to TiDB

1. Install the MySQL ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install mysql
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Customize the script `main.js` as needed
   - Change the connection arguments in `databaseOptions`
     - Format `uri` according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by Go-MySQL-Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#section-readme), or keep it as is
   - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `conn.query()`

1. Run the script:

   **Node.js:**

   ```sh
   node main.js
   ```

   **Bun:**

   ```sh
   bun run main.js
   ```

   **Deno:**

   ```sh
   deno run --allow-ffi --allow-env main.js
   ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker container running TiDB:

```sh
docker stop tidb-single
```
