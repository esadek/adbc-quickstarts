# Connecting Kotlin and Apache Doris with ADBC

## Instructions

This example uses [Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/), a high-performance, real-time analytical database.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have an Apache Doris instance running, skip the steps to set up Apache Doris.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)

1.  [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Apache Doris

> [!WARNING]
> This setup process has not been tested on Windows and might not work without modification. Windows users should run it under WSL.

1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

1.  Download the Apache Doris quick-start script:

    ```sh
    curl -O https://doris.apache.org/files/start-doris.sh
    ```

1.  Add Flight SQL ports and configure the backend to advertise `localhost`:

    ```sh
    sed -i.bak -f patch-doris.sed start-doris.sh
    ```

1.  Start an Apache Doris cluster:

    ```sh
    chmod 755 start-doris.sh
    ./start-doris.sh
    ```

### Connect to Apache Doris

1.  Install the Flight SQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install flightsql
    ```

1.  Customize the `main` function in `Main.kt`.
    -   Change the connection arguments in `params`.
        -   `uri` is the URI of your Apache Doris instance. The host and FE Arrow Flight SQL port will depend on your installation.
        -   `username` and `password` are the username and password of your Apache Doris user.
    -   Change the SQL `SELECT` statement in `stmt.setSqlQuery` if desired.

1.  Run the Kotlin program:

    ```sh
    gradle run
    ```

### Clean up

Stop the Docker project running Apache Doris:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-doris.yaml down
```
