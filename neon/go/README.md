# Connecting Go and Neon with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Neon instance running, skip the steps to set up and clean up Neon.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

### Set up Neon

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

2. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/install/)

3. Clone the [Neon repository](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
    ```

4. Start a Neon instance:

    ```sh
    docker compose --project-directory neon/docker-compose -p neon up -d
    ```

### Connect to Neon

1. Install the PostgreSQL ADBC driver:

    ```sh
    dbc install postgresql
    ```

1. Customize the Go program `main.go` as needed
    - Change the connection arguments in the `NewDatabase()` call
        - Format `uri` according to the [connection URI format used by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), or keep it as is. For cloud-hosted Neon, the connection string can be found at Project dashboard > Connect > Connection string
    - If you changed which database you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `stmt.SetSqlQuery()`

1. Run the Go program:

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    go run main.go
    ```

### Clean up

1. Stop the Docker project running Neon:

    ```sh
    docker compose -p neon down
    ```

2. Remove the Neon repository:

    ```sh
    rm -rf neon
    ```
