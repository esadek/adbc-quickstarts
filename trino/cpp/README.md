# Connecting C++ and Trino with ADBC

## Instructions

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Trino instance running, skip the steps to run Trino in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/)

1. [Install dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/getting_started/installation/)

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

### Set up Trino

1. Start Trino in a Docker container:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm --name trino -p 8080:8080 trinodb/trino
   ```

### Connect to Trino

1. Install the Trino ADBC driver:

   ```sh
   dbc install --level user trino
   ```

1. Customize the C++ program `main.cpp` as needed,
   - Change the connection arguments in the `AdbcDatabaseSetOption()` calls
     - Format the URI according to the [DSN (Data Source Name) format used by the Trino Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client#section-readme), or keep it as is to use the TPC-H data included in the Trino Docker container image
   - If you changed which Trino instance you're connecting to, also change the SQL SELECT statement in `AdbcStatementSetSqlQuery()`

1. Build and run the C++ program:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make
   ./trino_demo
   ```

   Or using CMake:
   ```sh
   pixi run cmake -B build
   pixi run cmake --build build
   ./build/trino_demo
   ```


### Clean up

1. Clean build artifacts:

   Using Make:
   ```sh
   pixi run make clean
   ```

   Using CMake:
   ```sh
   rm -rf build
   ```

1. Stop and remove the Docker container running Trino:

   ```sh
   docker stop trino
   docker rm trino
   ```
